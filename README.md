# ZaniPortals

This is a Minecraft server plugin that add player-created portals that are
"linked" together with a specific item, that can be treated like any other
item.  Players can, for example, create a portal and give out links to that
portal so that any player on the server can portal through to it.  It also
allows portals to link in any fashion, so that entering portal A leads to
portal B, which leads to portal C, and in any other fashion.
